	<h1><strong><u>HISTORY OF <span style="color:red"><cite><q>RedWings Business</cite></q></u></span><strong></h1>
	
	<h3>In 2013, CHARLES OWUSU BIH started RedWings Business to disrupt the overpriced and outdated </br>
	models of the Graphic design industry. Empowered by the people through crowdfunding, </br>
	our original watch line set us apart by bringing</br>
	you quality, minimalist designs at radically fair prices. Through social media</br>
	we grew far beyond.
	Our Western North home, becoming a global</br> community of 1.5 thousand owners (and counting).Weâ€™re inspired by</br>
	the go-getters, the innovators, the dreamers; and our designs embody this very spirit. <cite>Ezra Pound</cite> said,
	<q></q><br>If a man isn't willing to take some risk for his opinions, either his
	opinions are no good or he's no good.</q></h3>
